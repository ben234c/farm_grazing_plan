## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-alpha1] 2024-09-24

This is the first official alpha release of the farmOS Grazing Plan module.

It is considered "alpha" because it is still very much a proof-of-concept, and
is not going to be useful for most real-world grazing planning. It can be used
to visualize grazing events on a timeline, but using it for day-to-day
management is quite tedious. Moving forward, we hope to work as a community to
identify and prioritize next steps based on what would be most useful.

This project is inspired by the original
[farmOS v1 Grazing module](https://github.com/farmos/farm_grazing), but was
built from scratch with a new data architecture based on farmOS v3. The v1
module was designed around a specific prescriptive grazing management system,
but this one is designed to be more general. The hope is that it can be used as
a foundation to build more prescriptive workflows on top of.

Here is a summary of the major features this release provides:

### Added

- "Grazing" plan type, with a "Season" reference field
- "Grazing event" plan record type, with a "Log" reference field, a "Planned
  start date/time" field, and fields for "Duration (hours)" and "Recovery
  (hours)".
- Form for adding movement logs to the plan, along with plan-specific metadata.
- Gantt chart visualization of grazing events in the plan, using
  [svelte-gantt](https://github.com/ANovokmet/svelte-gantt), with the ability to
  view by asset or by location.
